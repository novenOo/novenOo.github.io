			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>I am just like everybody else. I am from Syria, and when I was a student there I pursued my dream of becoming a doctor, but sadly my ambitions were dealt a blow. I was forced to leave Syria and start my life as refugee--it was the only way to be safe. At that time, I had to let go of my dream of being a doctor, as there were no schools available for Syrian refugees. I had to keep looking forward to the best.

			That was three years ago. During that time I just was adjusting to my new life and new home, but was not learning anything. If I could go back in time and speak to my past, I would tell her that I wish she could have done more with her time.  Then something great happened, a school was built for the Syrian refugees and I discovered that I can complete my studies and work on my goals. 

			I started my studies, and within one year my friends told me about Re:Coded.
			Like a lot of people, I was not 100% satisfied with my life experience, so I decided to make a change. That change was finding Re:Coded.</p>
